# Generic Text Analyzer

The Generic Text Analyzer performs a comprehensive analysis of .txt files found in the `input` directory by extracting linguistic insights and visualizations. It reads each text file, preprocesses the content and generates frequency counts for words, n-grams, parts of speech, named entities and TF-IDF scores.

This program calculates readability metrics and sentiment, performs topic modeling using LDA and visualizes results through word clouds and bar charts. A detailed report is saved as a text file, and the content is also summarized using Anthropicâ€™s Claude API. All outputs, including visualizations and summaries, are stored in the `output` directory.
